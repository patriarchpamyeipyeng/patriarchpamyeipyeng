            <br><h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1><br>
            Dear Eileen,<br>
            <br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr>
            next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            <br><h1>Starting dates</h1>
            We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the dates for each one are as follows:
            <br><li>First semestrer: 9 September 2022</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2022</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2023</li>
            <br><br>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which you would prefer.<br><br>
            You can find more information about <a>important university dates</a>on our website.
            <br>Subjects of study<br>
            At Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
            <br><br><ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass at temperatures exceeding 30°C(86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
               So please can you provide information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
               <h1>Exotic dance moves</h1>
               Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>
               Polynesian chicken dance
               <ol>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</ol><br>
               Iceland brownian shuffle
               <ol>  Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say thaty he thought this dance inspired modern stylers such as Twerking.</ol>
               Arctic robot dance 
               <ol>
                An intersting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by"robotic" , stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northen Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.               </ol>
            For more of my research, see my <link>exotic dance research page.</link>
            Yours sincerely,
